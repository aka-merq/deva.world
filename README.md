  "DATA": {
    "id": *generate*new*uid*,
    "key": "*user*key*",
    "name": "*your*short*name*",

          "G": 163,
          "B": 41
        },

    },
    "services": {
      "world": "https://indra.ai/deva.world",
      "space": "https://indra.ai/deva.space",
      "cloud": "https://indra.ai/deva.cloud",
      "mud": {
        "key": "user",
        "host": "arjika.deva.cloud",
        "port": 9003,
        "user": {
          "login": "*your*username*",
          "password": "*your*password*"
        },
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Launch Application

Once you have edited your `./data/client.json` file then start the application with the `npm start` command. This will launch your server and tell you in the terminal what address and port to load the browser interface.

From here in the terminal you can interact in the shell or load a web browser with the address provided at launch.

Once you are in the system issue the `!help` command for more information on what todo next.
